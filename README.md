# The Great Firewords of China (WordPress Plugin)

Scan your website for words and phrases that the Chinese government considers sensitive. Edit or remove content the plugin identifies, and decrease the chance your site will be blocked by the Great Firewall of China. If your site’s already being blocked, this plugin can help you discover possible reasons why.

## FAQ
The Great Firewords of China WordPress plugin works in three ways:

1. It scans database content.
2. It scans theme and plugin content.
3. It actively monitors new pages, posts, and comments and alerts you when any sensitive words are added to your site.

You can activate scans using the menu options in the left column.

Please use your best judgement when editing any content the GFW plugin identifies as sensitive. The plugin relies on this list, which contains several generic terms such as “it,” “admin,” and “gov.” Your site won’t necessarily run afoul of the Chinese authorities just because our plugin identifies a sensitive keyword.

- Files are encoded with GB2312, but some characters inside will only work in some systems with GB18030
- Some words have Regex elements. Those must be escapped. Regex phrases should be inserted in their specific file.
