Scan your website for words and phrases that the Chinese government considers sensitive.

== Description ==
Scan your website for words and phrases that the Chinese government considers sensitive. Edit or remove content the plugin identifies, and decrease the chance your site will be blocked by the Great Firewall of China. If your site's already being blocked, this plugin can help you discover possible reasons why.

== Installation ==
1. Install and activate the plugin. (If you're unfamiliar with installing WordPress plugins, please read [this page from the Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins)).

2. You'll see a new top-level admin menu titled "GFW." Visit GFW > Overview to learn how the plugin works and to scan your site.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
The Great Firewords of China plugin works in three ways:

1. It scans database content.
2. It scans theme and plugin content.
3. It actively monitors new pages, posts, and comments and alerts you when any sensitive words are added to your site.

You can activate scans using the menu options in the left column.

Please use your best judgement when editing any content the GFW plugin identifies as sensitive. The plugin relies on [this list](https://github.com/jasonqng/chinese-keywords), which contains several generic terms such as "it," "admin," and "gov." Your site won't necessarily run afoul of the Chinese authorities just because our plugin identifies a sensitive keyword.

== Changelog ==
= 1.1 (11/22/17) =

WP 4.9 includes a new file editor, which allows users to edit any file at any directory level. This release of the GFW plugin takes advantage of this new feature. Users can now link directly from the file scan screen to theme and plugin files that contain banned keywords. We hope this makes editing these files easier.

= 1.0 (8/29/17) =

Initial release.
